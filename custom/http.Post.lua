---[SHARED AND MENU] Sends an asynchronous **POST** request to a HTTP server.
---
--- HTTP requests returning a status code >= `400` are still considered a success and will call the Structures/HTTPRequest callback.
---
--- The Structures/HTTPRequest callback is usually only called on DNS or TCP errors (e.g. the website is unavailable or the domain does not exist).
---
--- This cannot send or receive multiple headers with the same name.
--- HTTP-requests that respond with a large body may return an `unsuccessful` error. Try using the [Range](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Range) header to download the file in chunks.
---
--- 	HTTP-requests to destinations on private networks (such as `192.168.0.1`, or `127.0.0.1`) won't work.
---
--- 	To enable HTTP-requests to destinations on private networks use Command Line Parameters `-allowlocalhttp`. (Dedicated servers only)
