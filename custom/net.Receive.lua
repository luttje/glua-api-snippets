---[SHARED] Adds a net message handler. Only one receiver can be used to receive the net message.
--- The message-name is converted to lower-case so the message-names "`BigBlue`" and "`bigblue`" would be equal.
--- You **must** put this function **outside** of any other function or hook for it to work properly unless you know what you are doing!
---
--- You **must** read information in the same order as you write it.
---
--- Each net message has a length limit of **64KB**!
