<description>
Called when the player spawns for the first time.

See <page>GM:PlayerSpawn</page> for a hook called every player spawn.

<note>This hook is called before the player has fully loaded, when the player is still in seeing the \`Starting Lua\` screen. For example, trying to use the <page>Entity:GetModel</page> function will return the default model (\`models/player.mdl\`).</note>

<note>You can send <page>net</page> messages starting from the player_activate event (see <page>Game_Events</page>).</note>

<warning>Due to the above note, sending <page>net</page> messages to the spawned player in this hook are highly unreliable, and they most likely won't be received (more information here: https://github.com/Facepunch/garrysmod-requests/issues/718). 

Workaround without networking:
\`\`\`
local load_queue = {}

hook.Add("PlayerInitialSpawn", "myAddonName/Load", function(ply)
load_queue[ply] = true
end)

hook.Add("SetupMove", "myAddonName/Load", function(ply, _, cmd)
if load_queue[ply] and not cmd:IsForced() then
load_queue[ply] = nil

myAddon:OnPlayerNetReady(ply) -- Send what you need here!
end
end)
\`\`\`


With networking:
\`\`\`
-- CLIENT
hook.Add( "InitPostEntity", "Ready", function()
net.Start( "cool_addon_client_ready" )
net.SendToServer()
end )
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
-- SERVER
util.AddNetworkString( "cool_addon_client_ready" )

-- Send what you need here!
