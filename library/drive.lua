--- This hook is called from the default implementation of [GM:CalcView](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/GM:CalcView) which is [here](https://github.com/Facepunch/garrysmod/blob/master/garrysmod/gamemodes/base/gamemode/cl_init.lua#L387-L395). Therefore, it will not be called if any other hook added to `CalcView` returns any value, or if the current gamemode overrides the default hook and does not call [drive.CalcView](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/drive.CalcView).
