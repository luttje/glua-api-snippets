--- The math library is a standard Lua library that provides functions for manipulating numbers. In Garry's Mod several additional math functions have been added.
math = {}

--- An easing library that allows you to interpolate with various kinds of smoothing [functions](https://easings.net/). To use with [Global.Lerp](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Global.Lerp), input what you would to the fraction argument in one of these easing functions and then the output of that into the [Global.Lerp](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Global.Lerp) fraction argument.
