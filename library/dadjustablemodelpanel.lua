--- A derivative of the DModelPanel in which the user may modify the perspective of the model with their mouse and keyboard by clicking and dragging.
---
--- The keyboard keys W S A D Up Down Left Right Space and Ctrl can be used when the right mouse is held down, with Shift acting as a speed multiplier. When the left mouse is used, the Shift key holds the current `y` angle steady.
---
--- This is used by [IconEditor](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/IconEditor) for modifying spawn icons.

---[CLIENT] Enables mouse and keyboard-based adjustment of the perspective.
---
--- This is set to `true` automatically each time mouse capture is enabled, and hence doesn't serve as a usable setting, other than to disable this functionality after the [PANEL:OnMousePressed](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/PANEL:OnMousePressed) event.
