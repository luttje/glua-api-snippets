--- The undo library allows you to add custom entities to the undo list, allowing users to "undo" their creation with their undo (default: Z) key.
undo = {}

---![(Server)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d8fbe13a-6305-4e16-8698-5be874721ca1) Adds an entity to the current undo block
---
---[View wiki](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/undo.AddEntity)
---@param ent Entity The entity to add
function undo.AddEntity(ent) end

---![(Server)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d8fbe13a-6305-4e16-8698-5be874721ca1) Adds a function to call when the current undo block is undone. Note that if an undo has a function, the player will always be notified when this undo is performed, even if the entity it is meant to undo no longer exists.
---
---[View wiki](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/undo.AddFunction)
---@param func fun(undo: table, ...: any): boolean? The function to call.
---
--- Function argument(s):
--- * table `undo` - See Structures/Undo.
--- * vararg `...` - What was passed after the function callback argument.
---
--- Function return value(s):
--- * boolean `result` - Returning `false` will mark execution of this function as "failed", meaning that the undo might be skipped if no other entities are removed by it. This is useful when for example an entity you want to access is removed therefore there's nothing to do.
---@param ... any Arguments to pass to the function (after the undo info table)
function undo.AddFunction(func, ...) end

---![(Server)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d8fbe13a-6305-4e16-8698-5be874721ca1) Begins a new undo entry

---
--- You should use `gm_undo` or `gm_undonum *num*` console commands instead of calling this function directly.
