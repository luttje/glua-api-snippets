--- This is the list of utility functions.
util = {}

--- `util.worldpicker` is for picking an entity in the world while [GUI](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/gui) is open.
util.worldpicker = {}

---[SERVER] Adds the specified string to a string table, which will cache it and network it to all clients automatically.
--- Whenever you want to create a net message with [net.Start](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/net.Start), you must add the name of that message as a networked string via this function.
---
--- If the passed string already exists, nothing will happen and the ID of the existing item will be returned.
---
--- **NOTE**: Each unique network name needs to be pooled once - do not put this function call into any other functions if you're using a constant string. Preferable place for this function is in a serverside lua file, or in a shared file with the [net.Receive](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/net.Receive) function.
---
--- The string table used for this function does not interfere with the engine string tables and has 4095 slots.
--- This limit is shared among all entities, SetNW* and SetGlobal* functions. If you exceed the limit, you cannot create new variables, and you will get the following warning:
--- ```lua
--- Warning:  Table networkstring is full, can't add [key]
--- ```
--- **WARNING**: Existing variables will still get updated without the warning. You can check the limit by counting up until [util.NetworkIDToString](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/util.NetworkIDToString) returns nil
---
---[(View on wiki)](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/util.AddNetworkString)
---@param str string Adds the specified string to the string table.
---@return number # The id of the string that was added to the string table.
--- Same as calling util.NetworkStringToID.
function util.AddNetworkString(str) end

---[SHARED AND MENU] Function used to calculate aim vector from 2D screen position. It is used in SuperDOF calculate Distance.
---
--- Essentially a generic version of [gui.ScreenToVector](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/gui.ScreenToVector).
---
---[(View on wiki)](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/util.AimVector)
---@param ViewAngles Angle View angles

---
---[(View on wiki)](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/util.Base64Decode)
---@param str string String to decode.
---@return string # The raw bytes of the decoded string.
function util.Base64Decode(str) end

---[SHARED AND MENU] Encodes the specified string to base64.
---
--- **NOTE**: Unless disabled with the `inline` argument, the Base64 returned is compliant to the RFC 2045 standard. **This means it will have a line break after every 76th character.**
---
---[(View on wiki)](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/util.Base64Encode)
---@param str string String to encode.
---@param inline? boolean `true` to disable RFC 2045 compliance (newline every 76th character)

---[SHARED AND MENU] Compresses the given string using the [LZMA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LZMA) algorithm.
---
--- Use with [net.WriteData](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/net.WriteData) and [net.ReadData](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/net.ReadData) for networking and  [util.Decompress](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/util.Decompress) to decompress the data.
---
--- **NOTE**: The output of this function will have the uncompressed size of the data prepended to it as an 8-byte little-endian integer. [Source](https://github.com/garrynewman/bootil/blob/beb4cec8ad29533965491b767b177dc549e62d23/src/Bootil/Utility/CompressionLZMA.cpp#L56-L63)
---
--- You may therefore experience issues using the output of this function **_outside of Garry's Mod_**. If you need to do this, you will need to manually strip the first 8 bytes from the compressed output, or use third-party tools such as [gmod-lzma](https://github.com/WilliamVenner/gmod-lzma-rs) to decompress the output instead.
---
---[(View on wiki)](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/util.Compress)

function util.Compress(str) end

---[SHARED] Generates the [CRC Checksum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_redundancy_check) of the specified string.
---
--- 		**WARNING**: This is NOT a hashing function. It is a checksum, typically used for error detection/data corruption detection. It is possible for this function to generate "collisions", where two different strings will produce the same CRC. If you need a hashing function, use [util.SHA256](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/util.SHA256).
---
---[(View on wiki)](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/util.CRC)
---@param stringToChecksum string The string to calculate the checksum of.
---@return string # The unsigned 32 bit checksum.

---
--- This only works when used on a brush model and only if the decal material has set `$vertexcolor` to `1`.
---@param w number The width scale of the decal.
---@param h number The height scale of the decal.
function util.DecalEx(material, ent, position, normal, color, w, h) end

---@return string # Material path of the decal.
function util.DecalMaterial(decalName) end

---[SHARED AND MENU] Decompresses the given string using [LZMA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LZMA) algorithm. Used to decompress strings previously compressed with [util.Compress](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/util.Compress).
---
--- **NOTE**: This function expects the compressed input data to have the uncompressed size of the data prepended to it as an 8-byte little-endian integer. [Source](https://github.com/garrynewman/bootil/blob/beb4cec8ad29533965491b767b177dc549e62d23/src/Bootil/Utility/CompressionLZMA.cpp#L101)
---
--- If your compressed input data was compressed by [util.Compress](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/util.Compress), you don't need to worry about this - the uncompressed size of the data is already prepended to its output.
---
--- However, if your compressed data was produced using standard tools **_outside of Garry's Mod_**, you will need to manually prepend the length of the uncompressed data to its compressed form as an 8-byte little endian integer, or use third-party tools such as [gmod-lzma](https://github.com/WilliamVenner/gmod-lzma-rs) to compress your data instead.
---

---@param compressedString string The compressed string to decompress.
---@param maxSize? number The maximum size of uncompressed data in bytes, if greater it fails.

---
--- You will need to couple this function with [Global.IsFirstTimePredicted](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Global.IsFirstTimePredicted) if you want to use it in a [predicted hook](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Prediction).

function util.Effect(effectName, effectData, allowOverride, ignorePredictionOrRecipientFilter) end

---[CLIENT] Filters given text using Steam's filtering system. The function will obey local client's Steam settings for chat filtering:
---
--- **NOTE**: In some cases, especially in a chatbox, messages from some players may return an empty string if the context argument used for filtering is `TEXT_FILTER_CHAT` and [if the local player has blocked the sender of the message on Steam](https://github.com/Facepunch/garrysmod-issues/issues/5161#issuecomment-1035153941).
