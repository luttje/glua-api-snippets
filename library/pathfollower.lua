--- Path object for a NextBot NPC and bots created by [player.CreateNextbot](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/player.CreateNextbot). Returned by [Global.Path](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Global.Path).
---@class PathFollower
local PathFollower = {}

---[SERVER] If you created your path with type `"Chase"` this functions should be used in place of [PathFollower:Update](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/PathFollower:Update) to cause the bot to chase the specified entity.
---
---[(View on wiki)](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/PathFollower:Chase)
---@param bot NextBot The bot to update along the path. This can also be a nextbot player (player.CreateNextbot)
---@param ent Entity The entity we want to chase
---@param generator? fun(area: CNavArea, fromArea: CNavArea, ladder: CNavLadder, elevator: Entity, length: number): number A function that allows you to alter the path generation. See example on PathFollower:Compute for the default function.
---
--- Function argument(s):
--- * CNavArea `area` - The area to move to.
--- * CNavArea `fromArea` - The area to move from.
--- * CNavLadder `ladder` - The ladder to move to or from (Validation required), if any.
--- * Entity `elevator` - Will probably be always NULL
--- * number `length` - Precomputed length between `area` and `fromArea`.
---
--- Function return value(s):
--- * number `cost` - The cost of movement between `area` and `fromArea`.

---@return boolean # * If returns true, path was found to the goal position.
--- * If returns false, path may either be invalid (use IsValid() to check), or valid but doesn't reach all the way to the goal.
