--- This is a list of all available methods for all entities, which includes [Players](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Player), [Weapons](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Weapon), [NPCs](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/NPC) and [Vehicles](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Vehicle).
---
--- For a list of possible members of [Scripted Entities](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Scripted Entities) see [ENT Structure](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Structures/ENT)
---
---@class Entity
local Entity = {}

---
--- A list of hooks **only** available for [Scripted Entities](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Scripted Entities).
---
--- The exceptions to this rule are documented at [Custom Entity Fields](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Custom Entity Fields), which can be applied to all entities.
---
--- Some more "hooks" are available for all entities (including engine entities) with the function [Entity:AddCallback](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity:AddCallback).
---
--- See also: [Structures/ENT](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Structures/ENT)
---
--- **NOTE**: The hooks listed here are also dependent on the scripted entity type. For instance, a base scripted entity will not use [ENTITY:DoSchedule](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/ENTITY:DoSchedule) at all, that is only for scripted NPCs
---
---
---@class ENTITY : Entity
ENTITY = {}

---[SERVER] Called when another entity fires an event to this entity.
---
---[(View on wiki)](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/ENTITY:AcceptInput)
---@param inputName string The name of the input that was triggered.
---@param activator Entity The initial cause for the input getting triggered. (EG the player who pushed a button)
---@param caller Entity The entity that directly triggered the input. (EG the button that was pushed)
---@param data string The data passed.
---@return boolean # Should we suppress the default action for this input?
function ENTITY:AcceptInput(inputName, activator, caller, data) end

---[SHARED] Activates the entity. This needs to be used on some entities (like constraints) after being spawned.
---
--- **NOTE**: For some entity types when this function is used after [Entity:SetModelScale](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity:SetModelScale), the physics object will be recreated with the new scale. [Source-sdk-2013](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/source-sdk-2013/blob/55ed12f8d1eb6887d348be03aee5573d44177ffb/mp/src/game/server/baseanimating.cpp#L321-L327).
---
--- Calling this method after [Entity:SetModelScale](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity:SetModelScale) will recreate a new scaled `SOLID_VPHYSICS` [PhysObj](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/PhysObj) on scripted entities. This can be a problem if you made a properly scaled [PhysObj](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/PhysObj) of another kind (using [Entity:PhysicsInitSphere](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity:PhysicsInitSphere) for instance) or if you edited the [PhysObj](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/PhysObj)'s properties. This is especially the behavior of the Sandbox spawn menu.

function Entity:Activate() end

---[SHARED] Add a callback function to a specific event. This is used instead of hooks to avoid calling empty functions unnecessarily.
---
--- This also allows you to use certain hooks in engine entities (non-scripted entities).
---
--- **WARNING**: This method does not check if the function has already been added to this object before, so if you add the same callback twice, it will be run twice! Make sure to add your callback only once.
---
---[(View on wiki)](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity:AddCallback)
---@param hook string The hook name to hook onto. See Entity Callbacks
---@param func function The function to call. It's arguments and return values will depend on the hook specified in the first argument.

---[SHARED] Adds a [PhysObj](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/PhysObj)ect to the entity's motion controller so that [ENTITY:PhysicsSimulate](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/ENTITY:PhysicsSimulate) will be called for given [PhysObj](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/PhysObj)ect as well.
---
--- You must first create a motion controller with [Entity:StartMotionController](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity:StartMotionController).
---
--- You can remove added [PhysObj](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/PhysObj)ects by using [Entity:RemoveFromMotionController](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity:RemoveFromMotionController).
---
--- **NOTE**: Only works on a scripted [Entity](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity) of anim type
---

---@param to Angle The angle you want to align to
---@return Angle # The resulting aligned angle
function Entity:AlignAngles(from, to) end

---[CLIENT] Spawns a clientside ragdoll for the entity, positioning it in place of the original entity, and makes the entity invisible. It doesn't preserve flex values (face posing) as CSRagdolls don't support flex.
---
--- It does not work on players. Use [Player:CreateRagdoll](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Player:CreateRagdoll) instead.
---
--- The original entity is not removed, and neither are any ragdolls previously generated with this function.
---
--- To make the entity re-appear, run [Entity:SetNoDraw](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity:SetNoDraw)( false )
---
---[(View on wiki)](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity:BecomeRagdollOnClient)

---[SHARED] Called whenever the entity's position changes. A callback for when an entity's angle changes is available via [Entity:AddCallback](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity:AddCallback).
---
--- Like [ENTITY:RenderOverride](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/ENTITY:RenderOverride), this hook works on any entity (scripted or not) it is applied on.
---
--- **NOTE**: If EFL_DIRTY_ABSTRANSFORM is set on the entity, this will be called serverside only; otherwise, this will be called clientside only. This means serverside calls of [Entity:SetPos](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity:SetPos) without the EFL_DIRTY_ABSTRANSFORM flag enabled (most cases) will be called clientside only.
---
--- **NOTE**: The give concommand will call this hook serverside only upon entity spawn.
---
---[(View on wiki)](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/ENTITY:CalcAbsolutePosition)
---@param pos Vector The entity's actual position. May differ from Entity:GetPos

---[SHARED] Causes a specified function to be run if the entity is removed by any means. This can later be undone by [Entity:RemoveCallOnRemove](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity:RemoveCallOnRemove) if you need it to not run.
---
--- **WARNING**: This hook is called clientside during full updates. See [GM:EntityRemoved](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/GM:EntityRemoved) for more information.
---
---[(View on wiki)](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity:CallOnRemove)

--- * vararg `data` - Data passed from the arguments to `CallOnRemove`.
---@param ... any Optional arguments to pass to removeFunc. Do note that the first argument passed to the function will always be the entity being removed, and the arguments passed on here start after that.
function Entity:CallOnRemove(identifier, removeFunc, ...) end

---[SHARED] Controls if a property can be used on this entity or not.
---
--- This hook will only work in Sandbox derived gamemodes that do not have [SANDBOX:CanProperty](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/SANDBOX:CanProperty) overridden.
---
--- **NOTE**: This hook will work on ALL entities, not just the scripted ones (SENTs)

---
--- You must return a value. Not returning anything can cause unexpected results.
function ENTITY:CanProperty(ply, property) end

---[SHARED] Controls if a tool can be used on this entity or not.
---
--- This hook will only work in Sandbox derived gamemodes that do not have [SANDBOX:CanTool](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/SANDBOX:CanTool) overridden.
---
--- **NOTE**: This hook will work on ALL entities, not just the scripted ones (SENTs)
---

---
--- **WARNING**: This function must **not** be called inside of [GM:ShouldCollide](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/GM:ShouldCollide). Instead, it must be called in advance when the condition is known to change.
---
--- **WARNING**: Failure to use this function correctly will result in a crash of the physics engine.
---
---[(View on wiki)](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity:CollisionRulesChanged)
function Entity:CollisionRulesChanged() end

---[SERVER] Creates bone followers based on the current entity model.
---
--- Bone followers are physics objects that follow the visual mesh. This is what is used by `prop_dynamic` for things like big combine doors for vehicles with multiple physics objects which follow the visual mesh of the door when it animates.
---
--- Be mindful that bone followers create a separate entity (`phys_bone_follower`) for each physics object.
---
--- You must call [Entity:UpdateBoneFollowers](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity:UpdateBoneFollowers) every tick for bone followers to update their positions.
---
--- **NOTE**: This function only works on `anim`, `nextbot` and `ai` type entities.
---
---[(View on wiki)](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity:CreateBoneFollowers)

---[CLIENT] Creates a clientside particle system attached to the entity. See also [Global.CreateParticleSystem](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Global.CreateParticleSystem)
---
--- **NOTE**: The particle effect must be precached with [Global.PrecacheParticleSystem](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Global.PrecacheParticleSystem) and the file its from must be added via [game.AddParticles](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/game.AddParticles) before it can be used!
---
---[(View on wiki)](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity:CreateParticleEffect)
---@param particle string The particle name to create
---@param attachment number Attachment ID to attach the particle to
---@param options? table A table of tables ( IDs 1 to 64 ) having the following structure:
--- * number attachtype - The particle attach type. See Enums/PATTACH. **Default:** PATTACH_ABSORIGIN
--- * Entity entity - The parent entity? **Default:** NULL

---
--- If called inside [ENTITY:Draw](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/ENTITY:Draw) or [ENTITY:DrawTranslucent](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/ENTITY:DrawTranslucent), it only draws the entity's model itself.
---
--- If called outside of those hooks, it will call both of said hooks depending on [Entity:GetRenderGroup](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity:GetRenderGroup), drawing the entire entity again.
---
--- When drawing an entity more than once per frame in different positions, you should call [Entity:SetupBones](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity:SetupBones) before each draw; Otherwise, the entity will retain its first drawn position.

---
--- When used in a  hook such as [WEAPON:Think](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/WEAPON:Think) or [WEAPON:PrimaryAttack](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/WEAPON:PrimaryAttack), it will use [Player:LagCompensation](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Player:LagCompensation) internally.
---
--- **NOTE**: Lag compensation will not work if this function is called in a timer, regardless if the timer was made in a  hook.

---
--- Animations that loop will automatically reset the cycle so you don't have to - ones that do not will stop animating once you reach the end of their sequence.
---
--- **WARNING**: Do not call this function multiple times a frame, as it can cause unexpected results, such as animations playing at increased rate, etc.
---
--- [NextBot:BodyMoveXY](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/NextBot:BodyMoveXY) calls this internally, so do not call this function before or after [NextBot:BodyMoveXY](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/NextBot:BodyMoveXY).

---[SHARED] Returns the position and angle of the given attachment, relative to the world.
---
--- **WARNING**: This function can return entity's `GetPos()` instead if the entity doesn't have it's bone cache set up.

--- ```lua
--- local pos = ent:GetBonePosition(0)
--- if pos == ent:GetPos() then
--- 	pos = ent:GetBoneMatrix(0):GetTranslation()
--- end
--- ```
---
--- **NOTE**: This function returns the bone position from the last tick, so if your framerate is higher than the server's tickrate it may appear to lag behind if used on a fast moving entity. You can fix this by using the bone's matrix instead:
--- ```lua
--- local matrix = entity:GetBoneMatrix(0)
--- local pos = matrix:GetTranslation()
--- local ang = matrix:GetAngles()

---
--- This can return the server's position during server lag.
---
--- This can return garbage serverside or [Global.Vector](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Global.Vector)(0,0,0) for v49 models.

---[SHARED] Returns the position and angle of the entity as a 3x4 matrix ([VMatrix](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/VMatrix) is 4x4 so the fourth row goes unused). The first three columns store the angle as a [rotation matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_matrix), and the fourth column stores the position vector.
---
--- This returns incorrect results for the angular component (columns 1-3) for the local player clientside.

---[SHARED] Causes the entity to break into its current models gibs, if it has any.
---
--- You must call [Entity:PrecacheGibs](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity:PrecacheGibs) on the entity before using this function, or it will not create any gibs.
---
--- If called on server, the gibs will be spawned on the currently connected clients and will not be synchronized. Otherwise the gibs will be spawned only for the client the function is called on.

---
--- **WARNING**: NULL entities can still be assigned with key/value pairs, but they will be instantly negated. See example 3
---
--- This might be a cause for a lot of headache. Usually happening during networking etc., when completely valid entities suddenly become invalid on the client, but are never filtered with IsValid(). See [GM:InitPostEntity](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/GM:InitPostEntity) for more details.

function Entity:MuzzleFlash() end

---[SHARED] Performs a Ray-Orientated Bounding Box intersection from the given position to the origin of the OBBox with the entity and returns the hit position on the OBBox.
---
--- This relies on the entity having a collision mesh (not a physics object) and will be affected by `SOLID_NONE`
---

---@param position Vector The vector to start the intersection from.
---@return Vector # The nearest hit point of the entity's bounding box in world coordinates.
function Entity:NearestPoint(position) end

---[SHARED] Creates a network variable on the entity and adds Set/Get functions for it. This function should only be called in [ENTITY:SetupDataTables](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/ENTITY:SetupDataTables).
---
--- See [Entity:NetworkVarNotify](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity:NetworkVarNotify) for a function to hook NetworkVar changes.
---
--- **NOTE**: Entity NetworkVars are influenced by the return value of [ENTITY:UpdateTransmitState](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/ENTITY:UpdateTransmitState).
--- 	So if you use the **PVS**(**default**), then the NetworkVars can be different for each client.
---
--- **WARNING**: Make sure to not call the SetDT* and your custom set methods on the client realm unless you know exactly what you are doing.
---
--- Combining this function with [util.TableToJSON](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/util.TableToJSON) can also provide a way to network tables as serialized strings.
---
---[(View on wiki)](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity:NetworkVar)
---@param type string Supported choices:
---
--- * `String` (up to 511 characters)
--- * `Bool`
--- * `Float`
--- * `Int` (32-bit signed integer)
--- * `Vector`
--- * `Angle`
--- * `Entity`
---@param slot number Each network variable has to have a unique slot. The slot is per type - so you can have an int in slot `0`, a bool in slot `0` and a float in slot `0` etc. You can't have two ints in slot `0`, instead you would do a int in slot `0` and another int in slot `1`.
---
--- The max slots right now are `32` - so you should pick a number between `0` and `31`. An exception to this is strings which has a max slots of `4`.
---
--- This can be omitted entirely (arguments will shift) and it will use the next available slot.
---@param name string The name will affect how you access it. If you call it `Foo` you would add two new functions on your entity - `SetFoo()` and `GetFoo()`. So be careful that what you call it won't collide with any existing functions (don't call it `Pos` for example).
---@param extended? table A table of extended information.
---
--- `KeyName`
--- * Allows the NetworkVar to be set using Entity:SetKeyValue. This is useful if you're making an entity that you want to be loaded in a map. The sky entity uses this.
---
--- `Edit`
--- * The edit key lets you mark this variable as editable. See Editable Entities for more information.
function Entity:NetworkVar(type, slot, name, extended) end

---[SHARED] Similarly to [Entity:NetworkVar](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity:NetworkVar), creates a network variable on the entity and adds Set/Get functions for it. This method stores it's value as a member value of a vector or an angle. This allows to go beyond the normal variable limit of [Entity:NetworkVar](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity:NetworkVar) for `Int` and `Float` types, at the expense of `Vector` and `Angle` limit.
---
--- This function should only be called in [ENTITY:SetupDataTables](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/ENTITY:SetupDataTables).
---
--- **WARNING**: Make sure to not call the SetDT* and your custom set methods on the client realm unless you know exactly what you are doing.
---
---[(View on wiki)](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity:NetworkVarElement)
---@param type string Supported choices:
--- * `Vector`
--- * `Angle`
---@param slot number The slot for this `Vector` or `Angle`, from `0` to `31`. See Entity:NetworkVar for more detailed explanation.
---@param element string
--- 			Which element of a `Vector` or an `Angle` to store the value on. This can be `p`, `y`, `r` for Angles, and `x`, `y`, `z` for Vectors
---@param name string The name will affect how you access it. If you call it `Foo` you would add two new functions on your entity - `SetFoo()` and `GetFoo()`. So be careful that what you call it won't collide with any existing functions (don't call it "Pos" for example).
---@param extended? table A table of extra information. See Entity:NetworkVar for details.
function Entity:NetworkVarElement(type, slot, element, name, extended) end

---[SHARED] Creates a callback that will execute when the given network variable changes - that is, when the `Set()` function is run.
---
--- The callback is executed **before** the value is changed, and is called even if the new and old values are the same.
---
--- This function does not exist on entities in which [Entity:InstallDataTable](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity:InstallDataTable) has not been called.
---
--- By default, this means this function only exists on SENTs (both serverside and clientside) and on players with a [Player Class](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Player_Classes) (serverside and clientside [Global.LocalPlayer](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Global.LocalPlayer) only).
---
--- It's therefore safest to only use this in [ENTITY:SetupDataTables](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/ENTITY:SetupDataTables).
---
--- The callback will not be called clientside if the var is changed right after entity spawn.
---
---[(View on wiki)](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity:NetworkVarNotify)
---@param name string Name of variable to track changes of.
---@param callback fun(entity: Entity, name: string, old: any, new: any) The function to call when the variable changes.
---
--- Function argument(s):
--- * Entity `entity` - Entity whos variable changed.
--- * string `name` - Name of changed variable.
--- * any `old` - Old/current variable value.
--- * any `new` - New variable value that it was set to.

---
--- **NOTE**: Players are lag compensated by default and there's no need to call this function for them.
---
--- It's best to not enable lag compensation on parented entities, as the system does not handle it that well ( they will be moved back but then the entity will lag behind ).
--- Parented entities move back with the parent if it's lag compensated, so if you are making some kind of armor piece you shouldn't do anything.
---
--- As a side note for parented entities, if your entity can be shot at, keep in mind that its collision bounds need to be bigger than the bone's hitbox the entity is parented to, or hull/line traces ( such as the crowbar attack or bullets ) might not hit at all.

---
--- For some entities, calling [Entity:Activate](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity:Activate) after this will scale the collision bounds and [PhysObj](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/PhysObj) as well; be wary as there's no optimization being done internally and highly complex collision models might crash the server.

---[SHARED] Sets whether or not the given entity is persistent. A persistent entity will be saved on server shutdown and loaded back when the server starts up. Additionally, by default persistent entities cannot be grabbed with the physgun and tools cannot be used on them.
---
--- In sandbox, this can be set on an entity by opening the context menu, right clicking the entity, and choosing `"Make Persistent"`.
---
--- **NOTE**: Persistence can only be enabled with the sbox_persist convar, which works as an identifier for the current set of persistent entities. An empty identifier (which is the default value) disables this feature.

---@param fSpeed number How fast the animation will play.
function Entity:SetPlaybackRate(fSpeed) end

---[SHARED] Moves the entity to the specified position.
---
--- Some entities, such as ragdolls, will continually reset their position. Consider using [PhysObj:SetPos](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/PhysObj:SetPos) on every physics object to move ragdolls.
---
--- **NOTE**: If the new position doesn't take effect right away, you can use [Entity:SetupBones](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity:SetupBones) to force it to do so. This issue is especially common when trying to render the same entity twice or more in a single frame at different positions.
---
--- **WARNING**: Entities with [Entity:GetSolid](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity:GetSolid) of `SOLID_BBOX` will have their angles reset!
---
--- This will fail inside of predicted functions called during player movement processing. This includes [WEAPON:PrimaryAttack](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/WEAPON:PrimaryAttack) and [WEAPON:Think](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/WEAPON:Think).

---[CLIENT] Sets whether an entity should be predictable or not.
--- When an entity is set as predictable, its DT vars can be changed during predicted hooks. This is useful for entities which can be controlled by player input.
---
--- Any datatable value that mismatches from the server will be overridden and a prediction error will be spewed.
---
--- Weapons are predictable by default, and the drive system uses this function to make the controlled prop predictable as well.

--- Visit  for a list of all predicted hooks, and the [Prediction](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Prediction) page.
--- For further technical information on the subject, visit [valve's wiki](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Prediction).
---
--- **NOTE**: This function resets the datatable variables everytime it's called, it should ideally be called when a player starts using the entity and when he stops
---

---[CLIENT] Forces the entity to reconfigure its bones. You might need to call this after changing your model's scales or when manually drawing the entity multiple times at different positions.
---
--- **NOTE**: This calls the BuildBonePositions callback added via [Entity:AddCallback](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity:AddCallback), so avoid calling this function inside it to prevent an infinite loop.

---[SERVER] This is the spawn function. It's called when a player spawns the entity from the spawnmenu.
---
--- If you want to make your SENT spawnable you need this function to properly create the entity.
---
--- **WARNING**: Unlike other ENTITY functions, the "self" parameter of this function is not an entity but rather the table used to generate the SENT. This table is equivalent to [scripted_ents.GetStored](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/scripted_ents.GetStored)("ent_name").

--- Motion controllers are used internally to control other Entities' [PhysObj](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/PhysObj)ects, such as the Gravity Gun, +use pickup and the Physics Gun.
---
--- This function should be called every time you recreate the Entity's [PhysObj](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/PhysObj).

---[SERVER] Returns whether the target/given entity is visible from the this entity.
---
--- This is meant to be used only with NPCs.
---
--- Differences from a simple trace include:
--- * If target has `FL_NOTARGET`, returns `false`
--- * If `ai_ignoreplayers` is turned on and target is a player, returns `false`
--- * Reacts to `ai_LOS_mode`:
--- * * If `1`, does a simple trace with `COLLISION_GROUP_NONE` and `MASK_BLOCKLOS`
--- * * If not, does a trace with `MASK_BLOCKLOS_AND_NPCS` (- `CONTENTS_BLOCKLOS` is target is player) and a custom LOS filter (`CTraceFilterLOS`)
--- * Returns `true` if hits a vehicle the target is driving

---[SERVER] Returns true if supplied vector is visible from the entity's line of sight.
---
--- This is achieved similarly to a trace.

---[SHARED] Returns an integer that represents how deep in water the entity is.
--- 		**NOTE**: This function will currently work on players only due to the way it is implemented in the engine. If you need to check interaction with water for regular entities you better use [util.PointContents](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/util.PointContents).
---
--- * **0** - The entity isn't in water.
---
--- * **1** - Slightly submerged (at least to the feet).
---
--- * **2** - The majority of the entity is submerged (at least to the waist).
---
--- * **3** - Completely submerged.
