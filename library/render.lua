--- The render library is a powerful set of functions that let you control how the world and its contents are rendered. It can also be used to draw some 3D clientside effects such as beams, boxes and spheres.
render = {}

---[CLIENT] Adds a Beam Segment to the Beam started by [render.StartBeam](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/render.StartBeam).
---
--- 		For more detailed information on Beams, as well as usage examples, see the [Beams Render Reference](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/render_beams)

---@param width number The width of the beam.
---@param textureEnd number The end coordinate of the texture used.
---@param color table The color to be used. Uses the Color.

---[CLIENT] Blurs the render target ( or a given texture )
---
--- 		**WARNING**: Calling this on a RenderTarget created with TEXTUREFLAGS_POINTSAMPLE will result in strange visual glitching.
---
---[(View on wiki)](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/render.BlurRenderTarget)

---@param blurx number Horizontal amount of blur

---@param mat? IMaterial
function render.BrushMaterialOverride(mat) end

---[CLIENT] Captures a part of the current render target and returns the data as a binary string in the given format.
---
--- Since the pixel buffer clears itself every frame, this will return a black screen outside of render hooks. To capture the user's final view, use [GM:PostRender](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/GM:PostRender). This will not capture the Steam overlay or third-party injections (such as the Discord overlay, Overwolf, and advanced cheats) on the user's screen.
---
--- In PNG mode, this function can produce unexpected result where foreground is rendered as transparent.
--- This is caused by [render.SetWriteDepthToDestAlpha](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/render.SetWriteDepthToDestAlpha) set to `true` when doing most of render operations, including rendering in `_rt_fullframefb`. If you want to capture render target's content as PNG image only for output quality, set [Structures/RenderCaptureData](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Structures/RenderCaptureData)'s `alpha` to `false` when capturing render targets with [render.SetWriteDepthToDestAlpha](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/render.SetWriteDepthToDestAlpha) set to `true`.

---[CLIENT] Sets up the ambient lighting for any upcoming render operation. Ambient lighting can be seen as a cube enclosing the object to be drawn, each of its faces representing a directional light source that shines towards the object. Thus, there is a total of six different light sources that can be configured separately.

---[CLIENT AND MENU] Sets the Compare Function that all pixels affected by a draw operation will have their Stencil Buffer value tested against.
---
--- When not set to a static value like NEVER or ALWAYS, the Stencil Buffer value corresponding to each affected pixel will be compared against the current [Reference Value](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/render.SetStencilReferenceValue).
---
--- Pixels that **Pass** the Compare Function check move on to the Depth Test, which determines if the draw operation will ultimately be allowed to overwrite the pixel's Color Channel, Stencil Buffer, and Depth Buffer values.
---
--- Pixels that **Fail** the Compare Function check have the [Fail Operation](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/render.SetStencilFailOperation) performed on their Stencil Buffer value and do **not** have any of their Render Target layers modified by the draw operation.

--- Depending on the outcomes of these comparisons, one of either the [Pass](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/render.SetStencilPassOperation), [Fail](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/render.SetStencilFailOperation), or [Z-Fail](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/render.SetStencilZFailOperation) operations is performed on the pixel's Stencil Buffer value.
--- A pixel will only be updated in the active [Render Target](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/render_rendertargets) if the [Pass Operation](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/render.SetStencilPassOperation) is performed.
