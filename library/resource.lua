--- The resource library is used to control what files are sent to clients who join a server, this includes models, materials, sounds, text files but not Lua files.
resource = {}

---![(Server)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d8fbe13a-6305-4e16-8698-5be874721ca1) Adds the specified and all related files to the files the client should download from the server.
---
--- For convenience, this function will automatically add any other files that are related to the selected one, and throw an error if it can't find them. For example, a `.vmt` file will automatically add the `.vtf` with the same name, and a `.mdl` file will automatically add all `.vvd`, `.ani`, `.dx80.vtx`, `.dx90.vtx`, `.sw.vtx`, `.phy`, `.png` and `.jpg` files with the same name, with a separate error for each missing file.
---
--- If you do not want it to do this, use [resource.AddSingleFile](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/resource.AddSingleFile).
---
--- **WARNING**: There's a 8192 downloadable file limit. If you need more, consider using Workshop addons - [resource.AddWorkshop](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/resource.AddWorkshop). You should also consider the fact that you have way too many downloads. This limit is shared among all `resource.Add*` functions.
---
--- **NOTE**: The file must exist on the server it will not be added to the downloadables list!

---@param path string Virtual path of the file to be added, relative to `garrysmod/`.
--- Do not add `.bz2` to the filepath.
--- Do not put `gamemodes/*gamemodename*/content/` or `addons/*addonname*/` into the path.

--- If you wish to add textures or models, consider using [resource.AddFile](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/resource.AddFile) to add all the files required for a texture/model.

---![(Server)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d8fbe13a-6305-4e16-8698-5be874721ca1) Adds a workshop addon for the client to download before entering the server. This will not "install" the addon on your server, see [Workshop for Dedicated Servers](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Workshop_for_Dedicated_Servers) for installing Steam Workshop addons onto your servers.
---
--- Having the raw files from a workshop item does not count as having already downloaded it.
--- So players who previously downloaded a map through Fast Download will have to re-download it if it is part of a workshop addon.
---
--- You should try to only add addons that have custom content (models, sounds, etc).
---
--- Gamemodes that are [workshop enabled](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Gamemode_Creation#Gamemode_Text_File) and the current map are automatically added to this list, if they come from the servers' workshop collection - so there's no need to manually add them.
