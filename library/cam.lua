---
--- The matrix functions exist, but are mostly unusable unless you're familiar with the source engine's layout for each aspect.

---![(Client)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a5f6ba64-374d-42f0-b2f4-50e5c964e808) Returns a copy of the model matrix that is at the top of the stack.
--- 	**NOTE**: Editing the matrix **will not** edit the current view. To do so, you will have to use [cam.PushModelMatrix](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/cam.PushModelMatrix).

---![(Client)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a5f6ba64-374d-42f0-b2f4-50e5c964e808) Tells the renderer to ignore the depth buffer and draw any upcoming operation "ontop" of everything that was drawn yet.
---
--- This is identical to calling `render.DepthRange( 0, 0.01 )` for `true` and  `render.DepthRange( 0, 1 )` for `false`. See [render.DepthRange](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/render.DepthRange).

---![(Client)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a5f6ba64-374d-42f0-b2f4-50e5c964e808) Pops the current active rendering matrix from the stack and reinstates the previous one.

function cam.PopModelMatrix() end

---![(Client)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a5f6ba64-374d-42f0-b2f4-50e5c964e808) Pushes the specified matrix onto the render matrix stack. Unlike opengl, this will replace the current model matrix.
---
--- **NOTE**: This does not work with [cam.Start3D2D](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/cam.Start3D2D) if `multiply` is false.
---
--- **WARNING**: When used in the Paint function of a panel, if you want to rely on the top-left position of the panel, you must use [VMatrix:Translate](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/VMatrix:Translate) with the (0, 0) position of the panel relative to the screen.

---![(Client)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a5f6ba64-374d-42f0-b2f4-50e5c964e808) Sets up a new rendering context. This is an extended version of [cam.Start3D](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/cam.Start3D) and [cam.Start2D](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/cam.Start2D). Must be finished by [cam.End3D](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/cam.End3D) or [cam.End2D](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/cam.End2D).
---
--- This will not update current view properties for 3D contexts.

function cam.Start(dataTbl) end

---![(Client)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a5f6ba64-374d-42f0-b2f4-50e5c964e808) Sets up a new 2D rendering context. Must be finished by [cam.End2D](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/cam.End2D).
---
--- This is almost always used with a render target from the [render](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/render). To set its position use [render.SetViewPort](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/render.SetViewPort) with a target already stored.
---
--- **NOTE**: This will put an identity matrix at the top of the model matrix stack. If you are trying to use [cam.PushModelMatrix](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/cam.PushModelMatrix), call it after this function and not before.

---![(Client)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a5f6ba64-374d-42f0-b2f4-50e5c964e808) Sets up the model transformation matrix to draw 2D content in 3D space and pushes it into the stack ([cam.PushModelMatrix](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/cam.PushModelMatrix)).

---@param pos Vector Origin of the 3D2D context, ie. the top left corner, (0, 0).

--- +x in the 2d context corresponds to +x of the angle (its forward direction).
--- +y in the 2d context corresponds to -y of the angle (its right direction).
---
--- If (dx, dy) are your desired (+x, +y) unit vectors, the angle you want is dx:AngleEx(dx:Cross(-dy)).
---@param scale number The scale of the render context.
--- If scale is 1 then 1 pixel in 2D context will equal to 1 unit in 3D context.
