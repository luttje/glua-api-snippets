---
--- To enable this function for use on your server, add `-allowquit` to your commandline, which will make this function run `quit keep_players` when executed, this also does not forcibly disconnect players.
---
--- This is also available when running in server test mode (launch option `-systemtest`). Server test mode is used internally at Facepunch as part of the build process to make sure that the dedicated servers aren't crashing on startup.

---
--- You will notice that there's no server-side version of this. That's because there is no server when playing a demo. Demos are both recorded and played back purely clientside.

---![(Server)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d8fbe13a-6305-4e16-8698-5be874721ca1) This is a direct binding to the function `engine->LightStyle`. This function allows you to change the default light style of the map - so you can make lighting lighter or darker. Youâ€™ll need to call [render.RedownloadAllLightmaps](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/render.RedownloadAllLightmaps) clientside to refresh the lightmaps to this new color.
---
--- Calling this function with arguments 0 and "a" will cause dynamic lights such as those produced by the Light tool to stop working.
---
---[View wiki](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/engine.LightStyle)
---@param lightstyle number The lightstyle to edit. 0 to 63. If you want to edit map lighting, you want to set this to 0.
---@param pattern string The pattern to change the lightstyle to. `a` is the darkest, `z` is the brightest. You can use stuff like "abcxyz" to make flashing patterns. The normal brightness for a map is `m`. Values over `z` are allowed, `~` for instance.
function engine.LightStyle(lightstyle, pattern) end

---![(Client)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a5f6ba64-374d-42f0-b2f4-50e5c964e808) Loads a duplication from the local filesystem.
---
---[View wiki](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/engine.OpenDupe)
---@param dupeName string Name of the file. e.g, `engine.OpenDupe("dupes/8b809dd7a1a9a375e75be01cdc12e61f.dupe")`
---@return table # A table with a simple field:
--- * string `data` - Compressed dupe data. Use util.JSONToTable to make it into a format useable by the duplicator tool.
function engine.OpenDupe(dupeName) end

---![(Client)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a5f6ba64-374d-42f0-b2f4-50e5c964e808) Returns an estimate of the server's performance. Equivalent to calling [Global.FrameTime](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Global.FrameTime) from the server, according to source code.
---
---[View wiki](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/engine.ServerFrameTime)
---@return number # Frame time.
---@return number # Server framerate [standard deviation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation).
function engine.ServerFrameTime() end

---![(Menu)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/62703d98-767e-4cf2-89b3-390b1c2c5cd9) Sets the mounting options for mountable content.
---
---[View wiki](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/engine.SetMounted)
---@param depotID string The depot id of the game to mount.
---@param doMount boolean The mount state, true to mount, false to unmount

---![(Shared and Menu)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8f5230ff-38f7-493b-b9fc-cc70ffd5b3f4) Returns the number of ticks since the game server started.
---
---[View wiki](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/engine.TickCount)
---@return number # Number of ticks since the game server started.
function engine.TickCount() end

---![(Shared and Menu)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8f5230ff-38f7-493b-b9fc-cc70ffd5b3f4) Returns the time interval between each game tick in seconds.
---
--- This function is useful for making animations (usually serverside, such as doors rotating) and similar things to be independent of the tickrate in hooks that run at the tick rate, such as [GM:Tick](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/GM:Tick).
---
--- Clientside you'd want to use [Global.FrameTime](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Global.FrameTime) for this purpose in hooks that run every frame.
---
--- The default tickrate is `66.6666`, aka `16` milliseconds interval between each game tick.
--- The tickrate can be adjusted via the `-tickrate` [command line option](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Command_Line_Parameters).
---
---[View wiki](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/engine.TickInterval)
---@return number # Number of seconds between each gametick.
function engine.TickInterval() end

---![(Client)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a5f6ba64-374d-42f0-b2f4-50e5c964e808) **INTERNAL**: This is used internally - although you're able to use it you probably shouldn't.
