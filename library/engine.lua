--- The engine library provides functions to access various features in the game's engine, most are related to the demo and save systems.

---[SERVER] Closes the server and completely exits.
---
--- To enable this function for use on your server, add `-allowquit` to your commandline, which will make this function run `quit keep_players` when executed, this also does not forcibly disconnect players.
---
--- This is also available when running in server test mode (launch option `-systemtest`). Server test mode is used internally at Facepunch as part of the build process to make sure that the dedicated servers aren't crashing on startup.

---[SERVER] This is a direct binding to the function `engine->LightStyle`. This function allows you to change the default light style of the map - so you can make lighting lighter or darker. Youâ€™ll need to call [render.RedownloadAllLightmaps](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/render.RedownloadAllLightmaps) clientside to refresh the lightmaps to this new color.

---@param lightstyle number The lightstyle to edit. 0 to 63. If you want to edit map lighting, you want to set this to 0.
---@param pattern string The pattern to change the lightstyle to. `a` is the darkest, `z` is the brightest. You can use stuff like "abcxyz" to make flashing patterns. The normal brightness for a map is `m`. Values over `z` are allowed, `~` for instance.
