--- Library to work with the [LuaJIT](http://luajit.org/) functionality of gmod.
jit = {}

---[SHARED AND MENU] You can attach callbacks to a number of compiler events with jit.attach. The callback can be called:
---
--- * when a function has been compiled to bytecode (`"bc"`);
--- * when trace recording starts or stops (`"trace"`);
--- * as a trace is being recorded (`"record"`);
--- * or when a trace exits through a side exit (`"texit"`).
---
--- Set a callback with `jit.attach(callback, "event")` and clear the same callback with `jit.attach(callback)`
---
--- **WARNING**: This function isn't officially documented on LuaJIT wiki, use it at your own risk.
---
--- **WARNING**: Using these constantly (especially bytecode) can be very performance heavy due to the constant stream of data being compiled at a time.
---
---[(View on wiki)](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/jit.attach)
---@param callback function The callback function.
---
--- The arguments passed to the callback depend on the event being reported:
---
--- * `"bc"`:
---   * function **func** - The function that's just been recorded
--- * `"trace"`:
---   * string **what** - description of the trace event: "flush", "start", "stop", "abort". Available for all events.
---   * number **tr** - The trace number. Not available for flush.
---   * function **func** - The function being traced. Available for start and abort.
---   * number **pc** - The program counter - the bytecode number of the function being recorded (if this a Lua function). Available for start and abort.
---   * number **otr** - start: the parent trace number if this is a side trace, abort: abort code
---   * string **oex** - start: the exit number for the parent trace, abort: abort reason (string)
--- * `"record"`:
---   * number **tr** - The trace number. Not available for flush.
---   * function **func** - The function being traced. Available for start and abort.
---   * number **pc** - The program counter - the bytecode number of the function being recorded (if this a Lua function). Available for start and abort.
---   * number **depth** - The depth of the inlining of the current bytecode.
--- * `"texit"`:
---   * number **tr** - The trace number. Not available for flush.
---   * number **ex** - The exit number
---   * number **ngpr** - The number of general-purpose and floating point registers that are active at the exit.
---   * number **nfpr** - The number of general-purpose and floating point registers that are active at the exit.
---@param event string The event to hook into.

---[SHARED AND MENU] JIT compiler optimization control. The opt sub-module provides the backend for the -O command line LuaJIT option.
--- You can also use it programmatically, e.g.:
---
--- ```
--- jit.opt.start(2) -- same as -O2
--- jit.opt.start("-dce")
--- jit.opt.start("hotloop=10", "hotexit=2")
--- ```
---
--- 	A list of LuaJIT -O command line options can be found here(a table of various optimization levels are displayed towards the bottom of the page along with exactly which optimization options are enabled for each level): http://luajit.org/running.html

---[SHARED AND MENU] Retrieves LuaJIT information about a given function, similarly to [debug.getinfo](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/debug.getinfo). Possible table fields:
--- * linedefined: as for [debug.getinfo](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/debug.getinfo)
--- * lastlinedefined: as for [debug.getinfo](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/debug.getinfo)
--- * params: the number of parameters the function takes
--- * stackslots: the number of stack slots the function's local variable use
--- * upvalues: the number of upvalues the function uses
--- * bytecodes: the number of bytecodes it the compiled function
--- * gcconsts: the number of garbage collectable constants
--- * nconsts: the number of lua_Number (double) constants
--- * children: Boolean representing whether the function creates closures

--- * ffid: the fast function id of the function (if it is one). In this case only upvalues above and addr below are valid
--- * addr: the address of the function (if it is not a Lua function). If it's a C function rather than a fast function, only upvalues above is valid*

---[SHARED AND MENU] Gets a constant at a certain index in a function.
---
--- **WARNING**: This function isn't officially documented on LuaJIT wiki, use it at your own risk.
---
--- **NOTE**: Numbers constants goes from 0 (included) to n-1, n being the value of nconsts in [jit.util.funcinfo](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/jit.util.funcinfo) in other words, the consts goes from (nconsts-1) to -n

function jit.util.funck(func, index) end

---[SHARED AND MENU] Does the exact same thing as [debug.getupvalue](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/debug.getupvalue) except it only returns the name, not the name and the object. The upvalue indexes also start at 0 rather than 1, so doing `jit.util.funcuvname(func, 0)` will get you the same name as `debug.getupvalue(func, 1)`
