--- The file library provides functions for finding, reading and writing to files.
--- The following path values are most commonly used:
--- * `LUA` searches the lua files (in /lua/, in your gamemodes, in all the addons).
--- * `GAME` searches all the mounted content (main folder, addons, mounted games etc).
--- * `MOD` searches only the garrysmod folder.
--- * `DATA` searches in the data folder.
---
--- See [File Search Paths](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/File_Search_Paths) for the descriptive list of path values.
--- For the full list of path values, type `path` in the console.
