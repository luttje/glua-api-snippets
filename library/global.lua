---[SHARED] Marks a Lua file to be sent to clients when they join the server. Doesn't do anything on the client - this means you can use it in a shared file without problems.
---
--- 		**WARNING**: If the file trying to be added is empty, an error will occur, and the file will not be sent to the client
---
--- 		The string cannot have whitespace.
---
--- 		**NOTE**: This function is not needed for scripts located in these paths because they are automatically sent to clients.

---
--- The file path can be relative to the script it's ran from. For example, if your script is in `lua/myfolder/stuff.lua`, calling Global.AddCSLuaFile("otherstuff.lua") and Global.AddCSLuaFile("myfolder/otherstuff.lua") is the same thing.
---
--- Please make sure your file names are unique, the filesystem is shared across all addons, so a file named `lua/config.lua` in your addon may be overwritten by the same file in another addon.
function _G.AddCSLuaFile(file) end

---[CLIENT AND MENU] Loads the specified image from the `/cache` folder, used in combination with [steamworks.Download](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/steamworks.Download). Most addons will provide a 512x512 png image.

---[CLIENT] This function creates a World Tip, similar to the one shown when aiming at a Thruster where it shows you its force.
---
--- This function will make a World Tip that will only last 50 milliseconds (1/20th of a second), so you must call it continuously as long as you want the World Tip to be shown. It is common to call it inside a Think hook.
---
--- Contrary to what the function's name implies, it is impossible to create more than one World Tip at the same time. A new World Tip will overwrite the old one, so only use this function when you know nothing else will also be using it.

--- See [SANDBOX:PaintWorldTips](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/SANDBOX:PaintWorldTips) for more information.

---
--- Clientside entities are not garbage-collected, thus you must store a reference to the object and call [CSEnt:Remove](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/CSEnt:Remove) manually. **To workaround this bug, you need to hold a reference (in a variable) to the entity and remove it when necessary.**

---[SHARED AND MENU] An [eagerly evaluated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eager_evaluation) [ternary operator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%3F:), or, in layman's terms, a compact "if then else" statement.
---
--- In most cases, you should just use Lua's ["pseudo" ternary operator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%3F:#Lua), like this:
---
--- ```
--- local myCondition = true
--- local consequent = "myCondition is true"
--- local alternative = "myCondition is false"
---
--- print(myCondition and consequent or alternative)
--- ```
---
--- In the above example, due to [short-circuit evaluation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short-circuit_evaluation), `consequent` would be "skipped" and ignored (not evaluated) by Lua due to `myCondition` being `true`, and only `alternative` would be evaluated. However, when using `Either`, both `consequent` and `alternative` would be evaluated. A practical example of this can be found at the bottom of the page.
---
--- # Falsey values
---
--- If `consequent` is "falsey" (Lua considers both `false` and `nil` as false), this will not work. For example:
---
--- ```
--- local X = true
--- local Y = false
--- local Z = "myCondition is false"
---
--- print(X and Y or Z)
--- ```
---
--- This will actually print the value of `Z`.
---
--- In the above case, and other very rare cases, you may find `Either` useful.

---
--- ## .png, .jpg and other image formats
---
--- This function is capable to loading `.png` or `.jpg` images, generating a texture and material for them on the fly.
---
--- PNG, JPEG, GIF, and TGA files will work, but only if they have the `.png` or `.jpg` file extensions (even if the actual image format doesn't match the file extension)
---
--- Use [Global.AddonMaterial](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Global.AddonMaterial) for image files with the `.cache` file extension. (from [steamworks.Download](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/steamworks.Download))
---
--- While images are no longer scaled to Power of 2 (sizes of 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, etc.) sizes since February 2019, it is still a good practice for things like icons, etc.
---
--- **WARNING**: Server-side, this function can consistently return an invalid material (with '__error') depending on the file type loaded.
---
--- **WARNING**: This function is very expensive when used in rendering hooks or in operations requiring very frequent calls. It is a good idea to cache the material in a variable (like in the examples).
---
---[(View on wiki)](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Global.Material)
---@param materialName string The material name or path relative to the `materials/` folder.
--- Paths outside the `materials/` folder like `data/MyImage.jpg` or `maps/thumb/gm_construct.png` will also work for when generating materials.
---
--- To retrieve a Lua material created with Global.CreateMaterial, just prepend a `!` to the material name.
---@param pngParameters? string A string containing space separated keywords which will be used to add material parameters.
---
--- See Material Parameters for more information.

---[SHARED AND MENU] Writes every given argument to the console.
---
--- Automatically attempts to convert each argument to a string. (See [Global.tostring](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Global.tostring))
---
--- Unlike [Global.print](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Global.print), arguments are not separated by anything. They are simply concatenated.
---
--- Additionally, a newline isn't added automatically to the end, so subsequent Msg or print operations will continue the same line of text in the console. See [Global.MsgN](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Global.MsgN) for a version that does add a newline.
---
--- The text is blue on the server, orange on the client, and green on the menu:
