---
--- "Fixes" the current material of the [DImage](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/DImage) if it has VertexLit shader by creating a new one with the same name and a prefix of "_DImage" and automatically calling [DImage:SetMaterial](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/DImage:SetMaterial) with the new material.
---
--- This fixes the problem where using materials using shaders that expect lighting information causing "weird" flickering when displayed in 2D/Unlit environment.

---
--- Useful for cases like [DIconBrowser](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/DIconBrowser), where there are hundreds of small icons in 1 panel in a list that do not need all to be loaded at the same time.
