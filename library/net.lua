--- The net library is one of a number of ways to send data between the client and server.
---
--- The major advantages of the net library are the large size limit (64kb/message) and the ability to send data backwards - from the client to the server.
---
--- Refer to [Net Library Usage](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Net_Library_Usage) for a short introduction.

---
--- This function uses less bandwidth compared to [net.WriteVector](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/net.WriteVector) and will not send vectors with length of > 1 properly.

---![(Shared)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a356f942-57d7-4915-a8cc-559870a980fc) Appends a player entity to the current net message using its [Entity:EntIndex](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity:EntIndex). This saves a small amount of network bandwidth over [net.WriteEntity](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/net.WriteEntity).
---
--- See [net.ReadPlayer](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/net.ReadPlayer) for the function to read the entity.

---![(Shared)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a356f942-57d7-4915-a8cc-559870a980fc) Appends a string to the current net message. The size of the written data is 8 bits for every ASCII character in the string + 8 bits for the null terminator.
---
--- The maximum allowed length of a single written string is **65532 characters**. (aka the limit of the net message itself)
---
---[View wiki](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/net.WriteString)
---@param string string The string to be sent.
---
--- The input will be terminated at the first null byte if one is present. See net.WriteData if you wish to write binary data.

---![(Shared)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a356f942-57d7-4915-a8cc-559870a980fc) Appends a table to the current net message. Adds **16 extra bits** per key/value pair, so you're better off writing each individual key/value as the exact type if possible.
---
--- **WARNING**: All net messages have a **64kb** buffer. This function will not check or error when that buffer is overflown. You might want to consider using [util.TableToJSON](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/util.TableToJSON) and [util.Compress](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/util.Compress) and send the resulting string in **60kb** chunks, doing the opposite on the receiving end.
---
---[View wiki](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/net.WriteTable)
---@param table table The table to be sent.
---
--- If the table contains a `nil` key the table may not be read correctly.
---
--- Not all objects can be sent over the network. Things like functions, [IMaterial](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/IMaterial)s, etc will cause errors when reading the table from a net message.
---
--- Each element is also limited by the constraint of the `net.Write` function for the element type.
---@param sequential? boolean Set to `true` if the input table is sequential. This saves on bandwidth, adding **8 extra bits** per key/value pair instead of 16 bits.
---
--- To read the table you need to give [net.ReadTable](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/net.ReadTable) the same value!
function net.WriteTable(table, sequential) end

---
--- Appends any type of value to the current net message.
---
--- **NOTE**: An additional 8-bit unsigned integer indicating the type will automatically be written to the packet before the value, in order to facilitate reading with [net.ReadType](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/net.ReadType). If you know the data type you are writing, use a function meant for that specific data type to reduce amount of data sent.

function net.WriteType(Data) end

---![(Shared)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a356f942-57d7-4915-a8cc-559870a980fc) Appends an unsigned integer with the specified number of bits to the current net message.
---
--- Use [net.WriteInt](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/net.WriteInt) if you want to send negative and positive numbers. Use [net.WriteFloat](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/net.WriteFloat) for a non-whole number (e.g. `2.25`).
---
--- **NOTE**: Unsigned numbers **do not** support negative numbers.
---
---[View wiki](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/net.WriteUInt)
---@param unsignedInteger number The unsigned integer to be sent.
---@param bitCount number The size of the integer to be sent, in bits. Acceptable values range from any number `1` to `32` inclusive.

For reference: `1` = bit, `4` = nibble, `8` = byte, `16` = short, `32` = long.

Consult the table below to determine the bit count you need. The minimum value for all bit counts is `0`.

---@param uint64 string The 64 bit value to be sent. Can be a number.
---
--- 				Since Lua cannot store full 64-bit integers, this function takes a string. It is mainly aimed at usage with [Player:SteamID64](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Player:SteamID64).
---
--- 				If your input is a number and not a string, it won't be networked correctly as soon as it has more than 13 digits.
--- 				This is because Lua represents numbers over 13 digits as `1e+14`(`100 000 000 000 000`)
--- 				You can do something like this to convert it to a string: `string.format("%.0f", number)`.
--- 				If you try to use [Global.tostring](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Global.tostring) it will fail because it will create a result something like `1e+14` which doesn't work.

--- Vectors sent by this function are compressed, which may result in precision loss. XYZ components greater than `16384` or less than `-16384` are irrecoverably altered (most significant bits are trimmed) and precision after the decimal point is low.
