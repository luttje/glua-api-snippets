--- The net library is one of a number of ways to send data between the client and server.
---
--- The major advantages of the net library are the large size limit (64kb/message) and the ability to send data backwards - from the client to the server.
---
--- Refer to [Net Library Usage](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Net Library Usage) for a short introduction.
net = {}

---[SHARED] Cancels a net message started by [net.Start](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/net.Start), so you can immediately start a new one without any errors.

--- **NOTE**: Sometimes when sending a table through the net library, the order of the keys may be switched. So be cautious when comparing (See example 1).
---
--- You may get `net.ReadType: Couldn't read type X` during the execution of the function, the problem is that you are sending objects that **cannot** be serialized/sent over the network.

function net.ReadUInt64() end

---[SHARED] Reads a vector from the received net message. Vectors sent by this function are **compressed**, which may result in precision loss. See [net.WriteVector](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/net.WriteVector) for more information.

---
--- You can use the `net.Read*` functions within the message handler callback.
---
--- **NOTE**: The message-name is converted to lower-case so the message-names "`BigBlue`" and "`bigblue`" would be equal.
---
--- **WARNING**: You **should** put this function **outside** of any other function or hook for it to work properly unless you know what you are doing!
---

function net.SendPVS(position) end

---[CLIENT] Sends the current net message (see [net.Start](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/net.Start)) to the server. The player object must exist on the server for the net message to be received successfully by the server.
---
--- **WARNING**: Each net message has a length limit of 65,533 bytes (approximately 64 KiB) and your net message will error and fail to send if it is larger than this.

function net.SendToServer() end

---[SHARED] Begins a new net message. If another net message is already started and hasn't been sent yet, it will be discarded.
---
--- After calling this function, you will want to call `net.Write` functions to write your data, if any, and then finish with a call to one of the following functions:
--- * [net.Send](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/net.Send)

---
--- **WARNING**: Each net message has a length limit of 65,533 bytes (approximately 64 KiB) and your net message will error and fail to send if it is larger than this.
---
--- The net library has an internal buffer that sent messages are added to that is capable of holding roughly 256 kb at a time. Trying to send more will lead to the client being kicked because of a buffer overflow. [More information on net library limits can be found here.](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Networking_Usage#netlimits)
---
--- The message name must be pooled with [util.AddNetworkString](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/util.AddNetworkString) beforehand!
---
--- Net messages will not reliably reach the client until the client's [GM:InitPostEntity](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/GM:InitPostEntity) hook is called.

---[SHARED] Appends a string to the current net message. The size of the written data is 8 bits for every ASCII character in the string + 8 bits for the null terminator.
---
--- The maximum allowed length of a single written string is **65532 characters**. (aka the limit of the net message itself)
---
---[(View on wiki)](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/net.WriteString)

--- The input will be terminated at the first null byte if one is present. See net.WriteData if you wish to write binary data.
function net.WriteString(string) end

---[SHARED] Appends a table to the current net message. Adds **16 extra bits** per key/value pair, so you're better off writing each individual key/value as the exact type if possible.
---
--- **WARNING**: All net messages have a **64kb** buffer. This function will not check or error when that buffer is overflown. You might want to consider using [util.TableToJSON](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/util.TableToJSON) and [util.Compress](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/util.Compress) and send the resulting string in **60kb** chunks, doing the opposite on the receiving end.

--- If the table contains a `nil` key the table may not be read correctly.
---
--- Not all objects can be sent over the network. Things like functions, [IMaterial](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/IMaterial)s, etc will cause errors when reading the table from a net message.
---
--- Each element is also limited by the constraint of the `net.Write` function for the element type.
---@param sequential? boolean Set to `true` if the input table is sequential. This saves on bandwidth, adding **8 extra bits** per key/value pair instead of 16 bits.

--- Appends any type of value to the current net message.
---
--- **NOTE**: An additional 8-bit unsigned integer indicating the type will automatically be written to the packet before the value, in order to facilitate reading with [net.ReadType](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/net.ReadType).

function net.WriteUInt(unsignedInteger, bitCount) end

---[SHARED] Appends an unsigned integer with 64 bits to the current net message.
---
--- 		The limit for an uint64 is 18'446'744'073'709'551'615.
--- 		Everything above the limit will be set to the limit.
---
--- 		Unsigned numbers **do not** support negative numbers.

---@param uint64 string The 64 bit value to be sent. Can be a number.
---
--- 				Since Lua cannot store full 64-bit integers, this function takes a string. It is mainly aimed at usage with [Player:SteamID64](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Player:SteamID64).
---
--- 				If your input is a number and not a string, it won't be networked correctly as soon as it has more than 13 digits.
--- 				This is because Lua represents numbers over 13 digits as `1e+14`(`100 000 000 000 000`)
--- 				You can do something like this to convert it to a string: `string.format("%.0f", number)`.
--- 				If you try to use [Global.tostring](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Global.tostring) it will fail because it will create a result something like `1e+14` which doesn't work.
function net.WriteUInt64(uint64) end

---[SHARED] Appends a vector to the current net message.
--- Vectors sent by this function are compressed, which may result in precision loss. XYZ components greater than `16384` or less than `-16384` are irrecoverably altered (most significant bits are trimmed) and precision after the decimal point is low.
