--- This is the base panel for every other [VGUI](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/vgui) panel.
---
--- It contains all of the basic methods, some of which may only work on certain VGUI elements. See also [Panel Hooks](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Panel Hooks).
---
--- As their functionality is provided at the game's C/C++ level rather than by its Lua script extension, they are unfortunately unavailable for most practical purposes, however, they can still be obtained in a way similar to that provided by the [baseclass](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/baseclass) library:

--- -- but has a different SetText method than DLabel does - all without the hassle of that
--- -- old DLabel's default text getting in the way. Fun stuff.

--- This is a list of hooks that are available on all panels.

---
---[(View on wiki)](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Panel:AlphaTo)
---@param alpha number The alpha value (0-255) to approach.

---[CLIENT] Called every frame unless [Panel:IsVisible](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Panel:IsVisible) is set to false. Similar to [PANEL:Think](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/PANEL:Think), but can be disabled by [Panel:SetAnimationEnabled](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Panel:SetAnimationEnabled) as explained below.

---
--- If you want to "disable" this hook with [Panel:SetAnimationEnabled](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Panel:SetAnimationEnabled), you must call it after defining this hook. Once disabled, a custom hook **will not** be re-enabled by [Panel:SetAnimationEnabled](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Panel:SetAnimationEnabled) again - the hook will have to be re-defined.

---
--- You can do this manually using [file.Read](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/file.Read) and [util.JSONToTable](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/util.JSONToTable) to import and create a GWEN table structure from a `.gwen` file.

---
--- This is equivalent to calling [gui.MousePos](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/gui.MousePos) and then [Panel:ScreenToLocal](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Panel:ScreenToLocal).
---
--- **WARNING**: This function uses a cached value for the screen position of the panel, computed at the end of the last VGUI Think/Layout pass.
---
--- ie. inaccurate results may be returned if the panel or any of its ancestors have been repositioned outside of [PANEL:Think](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/PANEL:Think) or [PANEL:PerformLayout](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/PANEL:PerformLayout) within the last frame.

---
--- In order to use Lerp animation again, you must call [Panel:Stop](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Panel:Stop) before setting its `SetPosReal` property to `nil`. See the example below.
---
---[(View on wiki)](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Panel:DisableLerp)

function Panel:DistanceFrom(posX, posY) end

---[CLIENT AND MENU] Sets the dock type for the panel, making the panel "dock" in a certain direction, modifying it's position and size.
---
--- You can set the inner spacing of a panel's docking using [Panel:DockPadding](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Panel:DockPadding), which will affect docked child panels, and you can set the outer spacing of a panel's docking using [Panel:DockMargin](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Panel:DockMargin), which affects how docked siblings are positioned/sized.
---
--- You may need to use [Panel:SetZPos](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Panel:SetZPos) to ensure child panels ([DTextEntry](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/DTextEntry)) stay in a specific order.

When the panel's position is changed, it will move to the target position at the speed defined. You can undo this with [Panel:DisableLerp](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Panel:DisableLerp).
---
--- Unlike the other panel animation functions, such as [Panel:MoveTo](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Panel:MoveTo), this animation method will not operate whilst the game is paused. This is because it relies on [Global.FrameTime](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Global.FrameTime).

---[CLIENT AND MENU] Runs/Executes a string as JavaScript code in a panel.
--- **NOTE**: This function does **NOT** evaluate expression (i.e. allow you to pass variables from JavaScript (JS) to Lua context).Because a return value is nil/no value (a.k.a. void).If you wish to pass/return values from JS to Lua, you may want to use [DHTML:AddFunction](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/DHTML:AddFunction) function to accomplish that job.
