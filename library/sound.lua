function sound.Add(soundData) end

---![(Shared)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a356f942-57d7-4915-a8cc-559870a980fc) Overrides sounds defined inside of a txt file; typically used for adding map-specific sounds.

---@param hint number The hint to emit. This can be a bit flag. See Enums/SOUND
---@param pos Vector The position to emit the hint at
---@param volume number The volume or radius of the hint

---![(Client)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a5f6ba64-374d-42f0-b2f4-50e5c964e808) Creates a sound from a function.
---
---[View wiki](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/sound.Generate)
---@param indentifier string An unique identified for the sound.
---
--- 			You cannot override already existing ones.
---@param samplerate number The sample rate of the sound. Must be `11025`, `22050` or `44100`.
---@param length number The length in seconds of the sound to generate.
---@param callbackOrData fun(sampleIndex: number): number|table
--- 			A function which will be called to generate every sample on the sound.
---
---
---
--- Function argument(s):
--- * number `sampleIndex` - The current sample number.
---
--- Function return value(s):
--- * number `sampleValue` - The return value must be between `-1.0` and `1.0`.
--- 			Other values will wrap back to the -1 to 1 range and basically clip.
--- 			There are **65535** possible quantifiable values between `-1` and `1`.
---
--- 		This argument can also be given a table of samples, where values must range from `-1` to `1`.
--- 		This argument can also be a string of raw 16bit binary data, (each sample is unsigned short).
---@param loopStart? number Sample ID of the loop start. If given, the sound will be looping and will restart playing at given position after reaching its end.
function sound.Generate(indentifier, samplerate, length, callbackOrData, loopStart) end

---![(Server)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d8fbe13a-6305-4e16-8698-5be874721ca1) Returns the most dangerous/closest sound hint based on given location and types of sounds to sense.

---![(Shared)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a356f942-57d7-4915-a8cc-559870a980fc) Plays a sound from the specified position in the world.
--- If you want to play a sound without a position, such as a UI sound, use [surface.PlaySound](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/surface.PlaySound) instead.
---
--- This function is similar to [Global.EmitSound](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Global.EmitSound), but with less options.
---
---[View wiki](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/sound.Play)
---@param snd string The sound to play. This should either be a sound script name (sound.Add) or a file path relative to the `sound/` folder. (Make note that it's not sound**s**)
---@param pos Vector Where the sound should play.
---@param level? number Sound level in decibels. 75 is normal. Ranges from 20 to 180, where 180 is super loud. This affects how far away the sound will be heard, see Enums/SNDLVL.
---@param pitch? number The sound pitch. Range is from 0 to 255. 100 is normal pitch.
---@param volume? number Output volume of the sound in range 0 to 1.
---@param dsp? number The DSP preset for this sound. [List of DSP presets](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Dsp_presets)
function sound.Play(snd, pos, level, pitch, volume, dsp) end

---![(Client)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a5f6ba64-374d-42f0-b2f4-50e5c964e808) Plays a file from GMod directory. You can find a list of all error codes [here](http://www.un4seen.com/doc/#bass/BASS_ErrorGetCode.html)
---
--- For external file/stream playback, see [sound.PlayURL](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/sound.PlayURL).
---
--- This fails for looping .wav files in 3D mode.
---
--- This fails with unicode file names.
---
---[View wiki](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/sound.PlayFile)
---@param path string The path to the file to play.
---
--- Unlike other sound functions and structures, the path is relative to `garrysmod/` instead of `garrysmod/sound/`
---@param flags string Flags for the sound. Can be one or more of following, separated by a space (" "):
--- * 3d - Makes the sound 3D, so you can set its position
--- * mono - Forces the sound to have only one channel
--- * noplay - Forces the sound not to play as soon as this function is called
--- * noblock - Disables streaming in blocks. It is more resource-intensive, but it is required for IGModAudioChannel:SetTime.
---
--- If you don't want to use any of the above, you can just leave it as "".
---@param callback fun(channel: IGModAudioChannel, errorID: number, errorName: string) Callback function that is called as soon as the the stream is loaded.
---
--- Function argument(s):
--- * IGModAudioChannel `channel` - The sound channel. Will be nil if an error occurred.
--- * number `errorID` - ID of an error if an error has occurred. Will be nil, otherwise.
--- * string `errorName` - Name of an error if an error has occurred. Will be nil, otherwise.

---![(Client)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a5f6ba64-374d-42f0-b2f4-50e5c964e808) Allows you to play external sound files, as well as online radio streams.

---
--- For offline file playback, see [sound.PlayFile](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/sound.PlayFile).
---
--- Due to a bug with [BASS](http://www.un4seen.com/), AAC codec streams cannot be played in 3D mode.

---@param url string The URL of the sound to play
---@param flags string Flags for the sound. Can be one or more of following, separated by a space (`" "`):
--- * 3d - Makes the sound 3D, so you can set its position
--- * mono - Forces the sound to have only one channel
--- * noplay - Forces the sound not to play as soon as this function is called
--- * noblock - Disables streaming in blocks. It is more resource-intensive, but it is required for IGModAudioChannel:SetTime.

---![(Shared)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a356f942-57d7-4915-a8cc-559870a980fc) Sets the gender of a specific actor (model). This is a system from [base Half-Life 2](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Global_actors) - `global_actors.txt`.
---
--- This will affect what voice lines `npc_citizen` will use when they have the given model set.
---
--- It is not limited to `npc_citizens` - any sound played on any entity with given model can have gender specific sounds playing, including soundscripts, by including `$gender` token in the sound file path.
---
--- **WARNING**: Internally the gender is stored by model file name only (i.e. `models/alyx.mdl` would be stored as `alyx`), not the full path! Be aware of potential collisions.
---
---[View wiki](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/sound.SetActorGender)
---@param modelPath string Path to the model file to set the gender of.
---@param gender string Gender to set. Only 2 options are permitted: `female` and `male`. Any other option will be ignored.
