---![(Client and menu)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/25d1a1c8-4288-4a51-9867-5e3bb51b9981) Creates a new font.
---
--- To prevent the font from displaying incorrectly when using the `outline` setting, set `antialias` to false. This will ensure the text properly fills out the entire outline.
---
--- Be sure to check the [List of Default Fonts](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Default_Fonts) first! Those fonts can be used without using this function.
---
--- See Also: [Finding the Font Name](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Finding_the_Font_Name).
---
--- **WARNING**: Due to the static nature of fonts, do **NOT** create the font more than once. You should only be creating them once, it is recommended to create them at the top of your script. Do not use this function within [GM:HUDPaint](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/GM:HUDPaint) or any other hook!
---
--- Define fonts that you will actually use, as fonts are very taxing on performance and will cause crashes! Do not create fonts for every size.

This function does **not** handle newlines.
---
--- This function moves the [text position](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/surface.SetTextPos) by the length of the drawn text - this can be used to change text properties (such as font or color) without having to manually recalculate the text position. See example #2 for example use of this behavior.

---![(Client and menu)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/25d1a1c8-4288-4a51-9867-5e3bb51b9981) Draws a textured rectangle with a repeated or partial texture.
---
--- `u` and `v` refer to texture coordinates.
--- * (u, v) = (0, 0) is the top left
--- * (u, v) = (1, 0) is the top right
--- * (u, v) = (1, 1) is the bottom right
--- * (u, v) = (0, 1) is the bottom left
---
--- Using a start point of (1, 0) and an end point to (0, 1), you can draw an image flipped horizontally, same goes with other directions. Going above 1 will tile the texture. Negative values are allowed as well.
---
--- Here's a helper image:
---
--- See also [surface.DrawTexturedRect](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/surface.DrawTexturedRect) and [surface.DrawTexturedRectRotated](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/surface.DrawTexturedRectRotated).
---
--- **NOTE**: If you are using a .png image, you need supply the "noclamp" flag as second parameter for [Global.Material](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Global.Material) if you intend to use tiling.
---
--- **NOTE**: If you find that `surface.DrawTexturedRectUV` is getting your texture coordinates (u0, v0), (u1, v1) wrong and you're rendering with a material created with [Global.CreateMaterial](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Global.CreateMaterial), try adjusting them with the following code:
---
--- ```
--- local du = 0.5 / 32 -- half pixel anticorrection
--- local dv = 0.5 / 32 -- half pixel anticorrection
--- local u0, v0 = (u0 - du) / (1 - 2 * du), (v0 - dv) / (1 - 2 * dv)
--- local u1, v1 = (u1 - du) / (1 - 2 * du), (v1 - dv) / (1 - 2 * dv)
--- ```
---
--- **Explanation:**
--- `surface.DrawTexturedRectUV` tries to correct the texture coordinates by half a pixel (something to do with sampling) and computes the correction using `IMaterial::GetMappingWidth()`/`GetMappingHeight()`. If the material was created without a `$basetexture`, then `GetMappingWidth()`/`GetMappingHeight()` uses the width and height of the error material (which is 32x32).
---
--- The UV offsets might require (sub-)pixel correction for accurate tiling results.
