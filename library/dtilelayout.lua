--- Similarly to [DIconLayout](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/DIconLayout), this lays out panels in two dimensions as tiles.
---
--- The difference between this and [DIconLayout](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/DIconLayout) is that [DIconLayout](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/DIconLayout) items all have the same height while
--- [DTileLayout](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/DTileLayout) items do not have this enforcement.
--- [DTileLayout](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/DTileLayout) will find the best way to "pack" its children.
--- For example, in a two column layout, a item of height 2 units will be placed in one column while
--- two items of height 1 unit will be placed in the other column.
---
--- It is worth noting however that because this panel iterates through its children in an undefined order and lays out while
--- it is iterating, there is no guarantee that this packing will lead to the lowest possible height.
---
--- This is used by the spawnmenu to arrange spawnicons.
---
--- The base size defines the smallest a tile can be, and it will resize vertically to accommodate all child panels.
--- The number of elements in each row is determined by the base size and width.
---
--- It also optionally permits the rearrangement of these tiles.
--- To enable this functionality, call [DDragBase:MakeDroppable](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/DDragBase:MakeDroppable) on the DTileLayout with a unique identifier.
--- All panels added following this will be moveable.
