local Vector = {}

---[SHARED AND MENU] Adds the values of the argument vector to the original vector. This function is the same as vector1 + vector2 without creating a new vector object, skipping object construction and garbage collection.
---
---[(View on wiki)](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Vector:Add)
---@param vector Vector The vector to add.
function Vector:Add(vector) end

---[SHARED AND MENU] Returns an angle representing the normal of the vector.
---
---[(View on wiki)](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Vector:Angle)
---@return Angle # The angle/direction of the vector.
function Vector:Angle() end

---[SHARED AND MENU] Returns the angle of this vector (normalized), but instead of assuming that up is [Global.Vector](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Global.Vector)( 0, 0, 1 ) (Like [Vector:Angle](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Vector:Angle) does) you can specify which direction is 'up' for the angle.

---[(View on wiki)](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Vector:AngleEx)
---@param up Vector The up direction vector
---@return Angle # The angle
function Vector:AngleEx(up) end

---[SHARED AND MENU] Calculates the cross product of this vector and the passed one.
---
--- The cross product of two vectors is a 3-dimensional vector with a direction perpendicular (at right angles) to both of them (according to the [right-hand rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-hand_rule)), and magnitude equal to the area of parallelogram they span. This is defined as the product of the magnitudes, the sine of the angle between them, and unit (normal) vector `n` defined by the right-hand rule:
--- :**a** &times; **b** = |**a**| |**b**| sin(&theta;) **n̂**
--- where **a** and **b** are vectors, and **n̂** is a unit vector (magnitude of 1) perpendicular to both.
---
---[(View on wiki)](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Vector:Cross)
---@param otherVector Vector Vector to calculate the cross product with.
---@return Vector # The cross product of the two vectors.
function Vector:Cross(otherVector) end

---[SHARED AND MENU] Returns the Euclidean distance between the vector and the other vector.
---
--- **NOTE**: This function is more expensive than [Vector:DistToSqr](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Vector:DistToSqr). However, please see the notes for [Vector:DistToSqr](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Vector:DistToSqr) before using it as squared distances are not the same as euclidean distances.
---
---[(View on wiki)](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Vector:Distance)
---@param otherVector Vector The vector to get the distance to.
---@return number # Distance between the vectors.
function Vector:Distance(otherVector) end

---[SHARED AND MENU] Returns the Euclidean distance between the vector and the other vector in 2D space. The Z axis is ignored.
---
--- **NOTE**: This function is more expensive than [Vector:Distance2DSqr](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Vector:Distance2DSqr). However, please see the notes for [Vector:Distance2DSqr](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Vector:Distance2DSqr) before using it as squared distances are not the same as Euclidean distances.
---
---[(View on wiki)](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Vector:Distance2D)
---@param otherVector Vector The vector to get the distance to.
---@return number # Distance between the vectors in 2D space.
function Vector:Distance2D(otherVector) end

---[SHARED AND MENU] Returns the squared distance between 2 vectors in 2D space, ignoring the Z axis. This is faster than [Vector:Distance2D](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Vector:Distance2D) as calculating the square root is an expensive process.
---
--- 	**NOTE**: Squared distances should not be summed. If you need to sum distances, use [Vector:Distance2D](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Vector:Distance2D).
---
--- When performing a distance check, ensure the distance being checked against is squared.
---
---[(View on wiki)](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Vector:Distance2DSqr)
---@param otherVec Vector The vector to calculate the distance to.
---@return number # Squared distance to the vector in 2D space.
function Vector:Distance2DSqr(otherVec) end

---[SHARED AND MENU] Returns the squared distance of 2 vectors, this is quicker to call than [Vector:Distance](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Vector:Distance) as DistToSqr does not need to calculate the square root, which is an expensive process.
---
--- 	**NOTE**: Squared distances should not be summed. If you need to sum distances, use [Vector:Distance](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Vector:Distance).
---
--- When performing a distance check, ensure the distance being checked against is squared. See example code below.
---
---[(View on wiki)](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Vector:DistToSqr)
---@param otherVec Vector The vector to calculate the distance to.
---@return number # Squared distance to the vector.
function Vector:DistToSqr(otherVec) end

---[SHARED AND MENU] Divide the vector by the given number, that means x, y and z are divided by that value. This will change the value of the original vector, see example 2 for division without changing the value.
---
---[(View on wiki)](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Vector:Div)
---@param divisor number The value to divide the vector with.
function Vector:Div(divisor) end

---[SHARED AND MENU] Returns the [dot product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product#Geometric_definition)  of this vector and the passed one.
---
--- The dot product of two vectors is the product of their magnitudes (lengths), and the cosine of the angle between them:
--- **a · b** = |**a**| |**b**| cos(θ)
--- where **a** and **b** are vectors.
--- See [Vector:Length](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Vector:Length) for obtaining magnitudes.
---
--- A dot product returns just the cosine of the angle if both vectors are normalized, and zero if the vectors are at right angles to each other.
---

---@param otherVector Vector The vector to calculate the dot product with
---@return number # The dot product between the two vectors

---@return Vector # Normalized version of the vector.
---@deprecated Use Vector:GetNormalized instead.
function Vector:GetNormal() end

---[SHARED AND MENU] Returns a normalized version of the vector. Normalized means vector with same direction but with length of 1.
---
--- This does not affect the vector you call it on; to do this, use [Vector:Normalize](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Vector:Normalize).
---
---[(View on wiki)](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Vector:GetNormalized)

---@param multiplier number The value to scale the vector with.
function Vector:Mul(multiplier) end

---[CLIENT] Returns where on the screen the specified position vector would appear. A related function is [gui.ScreenToVector](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/gui.ScreenToVector), which converts a 2D coordinate to a 3D direction.
---
--- **NOTE**: Should be called from a 3D rendering environment or after [cam.Start3D](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/cam.Start3D) or it may not work correctly.
---
--- Errors in a render hook can make this value incorrect until the player restarts their game.
---
--- [cam.Start3D](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/cam.Start3D) or 3D context [cam.Start](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/cam.Start) with non-default parameters incorrectly sets the reference FOV for this function, causing incorrect return values. This can be fixed by creating and ending a default 3D context ([cam.Start3D](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/cam.Start3D) with no arguments).
