---
--- You shouldn't adjust the player's position in any way in the move hook. This is because due to prediction errors, the netcode might run the move hook multiple times as packets arrive late. Therefore you should only adjust the movedata construct in this hook.
---
--- Generally you shouldn't have to use this hook - if you want to make a custom move type you should look at the drive system.
---
--- This hook is called after [GM:PlayerTick](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/GM:PlayerTick).

---
--- 	**WARNING**: This function now uses [player.Iterator](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/player.Iterator).

---
--- **NOTE**: Some entities on initial map spawn are passed through this hook, and then removed in the same frame. This is used by the engine to precache things like models and sounds, so always check their validity with [Global.IsValid](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Global.IsValid). Will not require [Global.IsValid](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Global.IsValid) check if you create your hook after [GM:InitPostEntity](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/GM:InitPostEntity).

---
--- See [GM:PlayerSpawn](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/GM:PlayerSpawn) for a hook called every player spawn.
---
--- **NOTE**: This hook is called before the player has fully loaded, when the player is still in seeing the `Starting Lua` screen. For example, trying to use the [Entity:GetModel](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity:GetModel) function will return the default model (`models/player.mdl`).
---
--- **WARNING**: Due to the above note, sending [net](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/net) messages to the spawned player in this hook may cause them to be received before the player finishes loading, for example [Global.LocalPlayer](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Global.LocalPlayer) might return NULL since [GM:InitPostEntity](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/GM:InitPostEntity) may have not been called yet clientside though the net message **won't** be lost and the client still should receive it (more information here: https://github.com/Facepunch/garrysmod-requests/issues/718).
---
--- Workaround without networking:
--- ```
--- local load_queue = {}

--- 	load_queue[ ply ] = true

This is only called if [Entity:SetCustomCollisionCheck](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity:SetCustomCollisionCheck) was used on one or both entities.
---
--- Where applicable, consider using [constraint.NoCollide](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/constraint.NoCollide) or a [logic_collision_pair](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Logic_collision_pair) entity instead - they are considerably easier to use and may be more appropriate in some situations.
---
--- **WARNING**: This hook **must** return the same value consistently for the same pair of entities.
--- 	If an entity changed in such a way that its collision rules change, you **must** call [Entity:CollisionRulesChanged](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity:CollisionRulesChanged) on that entity immediately - **not in this hook and not in physics callbacks.**
--- 	As long as you religiously follow the rules set by the examples this hook will work reliably without breaking, even a small mistake might break physics.
---
--- This hook can cause all physics to break under certain conditions.

---
--- If you're using this hook to draw a player for a [GM:CalcView](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/GM:CalcView) hook, then you may want to consider using the `drawviewer` variable you can use in your [Structures/CamData](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Structures/CamData) table instead.
---
--- **NOTE**: This hook has an internal cache that is reset at the start of every frame. This will prevent this hook from running in certain cases. This cache is reset in [cam.Start](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/cam.Start) and in a future update in [render.RenderView](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/render.RenderView) when rendering extra views.
