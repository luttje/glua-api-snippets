--- **NOTE**: Setting this to 0 will disable the projected texture completely! This may be useful if you want to disable a projected texture without actually removing it
---
--- **NOTE**: This seems to affect the rendering of shadows - a higher Near Z value will have shadows begin to render closer to their casting object. Comparing a low Near Z value (like 1) with a normal one (12) or high one (1000) is the easiest way to understand this artifact
